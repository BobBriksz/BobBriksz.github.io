I was a Bartender in New York City for 5 years. Do you know Macy’s? Like THE Macy’s, as in The Thanksgiving Day Parade? Did you know there were 3 restaurants inside that behemoth of a department store? Imagine, if you will, the world’s largest department store smack dab in the middle of the shopping capital of the world, then you’ll start to get a sense of how many customers came and went through those doors in a day. Then during the holiday season triple that number. As a result my experiences have molded me into a strong worker, who can be efficient, communicative and even fun while under pressure.

When I wasn’t bartending I was avidly listening to NPR, trying to figure out exactly how the country does, or doesnt work. This blossomed into a fascination for civics, as well as the importance of social justice. After the pandemic began, the disparities have only become more clear and I think it will be important to address these problems with aggressive data driven analysis to provide impactful, and fact based decision making.

Now I am pursuing this by participating in LambdaSchools Data Science program. I am excited to learn how to use data to communicate to the masses, using all the skills I hope to learn from this program.

Please feel free to reach out if you have questions about any of my projects, or if you just need a tasty cocktail suggestion! Cheers!
