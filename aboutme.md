Howdy! I am a student at Lambda school, after working for the alst 5 years as a bartender in high end restaurants in New York city, I have decided to make the switch out of that career(Not that I had much of a choice) to Data science! Here I hope to put some of my findings and Lambda projects, hopefully some interesting things will come up!
